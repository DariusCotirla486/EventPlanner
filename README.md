EventPlanner is a C++ application that allows multiple users (persons) to interact with different events through their own dedicated windows.

Key features:
  - Multiple Windows: Each person has their own window to interact with events.
  - Real-time Event Updates: Changes to an event's participation status are instantly reflected across all connected persons using the Subject/Observer model, where the Event board is the "Subject" and the users are the "Observers".
  - OOP Architecture: The application is designed using Object-Oriented principles, with classes for handling events, persons, and their interactions.
